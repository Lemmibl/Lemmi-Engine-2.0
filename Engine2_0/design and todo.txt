TODO:
* remove transform from Model. remove model completely? modelhandler being a thing?
* Go over all handlers and make sure they use the same way to access objects. ALSO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN ACCESS THE ARRAY.
* Change shader system to use polyporphism and generic Shader* ptrs. ShaderManager would be a .... std::map<Shader*, shaderEnum> ?
* Shader* would have a virtual destructor, a pure virtual Render(Scene*) and a pure virtual Setup(Scene*)...?
* Camera.
* A game menu? Like.. Start Game / Load Game / Configure Parameters
* Remake terrainManager from... scratch? Reuse all the good parts. Plenty that works just fine. Clean up the multithreaded function though. Look into multithreaded openGL contexts.





Design...?:
* Regarding the job queue manager: probably only be used in .... the actual game? Or not? Separate UI thread?


* This is probably how the actual game is set up:

* GameplayScreen owns:
	Game.
	"New game menu" ?
		-> This menu will let you configure things before starting the game. So you can select like, terrain type, vegetation levels and shit.

	Game owns:
		Scene.

		TerrainManager.
			-> TerrainManager creates part of scene.
		GameRenderer.
			-> GameRenderer draws Scene.
		Physics.
			-> Physics updates Scene.
		AI.
			-> AI processes upon Scene.

		Etc.

			Scene contains:
				Entities!
				Many different types of entities.. Maybe?
				Or just........ Pointers.. Handles?

* How to approach setting up the rendering:
	- Maybe look at how other renderers do it? Render queue? Sorting by flags? Using those sexy sexy dod-arrays?
		-> SCENE???? Use a Scene?

	//http://www.gamedev.net/topic/641759-sorting-draw-calls-when-stages-are-executed-multiple-times/
	//http://lspiroengine.com/?p=96

	* First setup the Shadow pass -> Gbuffer -> Light and post processing -> Compose
	* Then skysphere
	* Then... terrain? Marching cubes. Try to clean up terrain generator.


Maybe being able to set up a vector of "Render Passes". Where you can sort them in order and specify what they're named and what key they have, what shader they should render etc.


* For culling use bulletphysics built in: http://bulletphysics.org/Bullet/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=3896&hilit=culling

struct RenderPass
{
	enum PassName
	string PassNameDebug
	vector<Shader> shaders //stored in order of execution I guess? 0 being first
	long flags //this is what we'll match objects against, I guess? does this need to be here?
	std::function renderpassfunction?
}

* When/if stuff gets flagged for deletion, add their... entity? ID to remove all relevant objects everywhere



STD::ARRAY NOT STD::VECTOR!




MeshHandle 		returned from MeshHandler->LoadMesh()
TextureHandle 	returned from TextureHandler->LoadTexture()
MaterialHandle 	returned from MaterialHandler->LoadMaterial()


A model is an aggregation of mesh handles, texture handles and material handles.

There's a model handler that owns a ptr to mesh handler, a ptr to texture handler and a ptr to material handler.


...ModelHandler->LoadModel() return a handle that a renderable can use

ModelHandler->GetModel would return a reference to const model
ModelHandler->CopyModel could be used to check out a (by value) model for editing
ModelHandler->InsertNewModel could be used to check it in again

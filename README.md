I use the following libraries:

* GLFW      -> http://www.glfw.org/
* Libconfig -> http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/
* Visual Leak Detector (Only while debugging, of course) -> https://vld.codeplex.com/

I also use code from the following people:
* Christian Schladetsch's Event code -> http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2011/10/30/c-events/

If I have missed anyone it's purely by accident. If you find anything that doesn't seem to be my code, don't hesitate to contact me.
